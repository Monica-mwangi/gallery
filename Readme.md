 Dark Room Project - Cloud Deployment with CI/CD

This repository contains the **Dark Room** application, which we are transforming into a cloud-based application with continuous integration and deployment using **Render**, **MongoDB Atlas**, and **Jenkins**. Follow the milestones below to complete the project.

---

## Milestone 1: Set Up

1. **Fork and Clone** this repository.  
   This is an already working application that we will be translating into a cloud-based application.

2. **Database Setup**  
   The application uses a MongoDB database. To deploy to Render, we will use **MongoDB Atlas**, a cloud-hosted MongoDB service. Follow [this tutorial](#) to set up your cluster.

3. **Configure `_config.js`**  
   Once youâ€™ve created a cluster and a database user on MongoDB Atlas, update the `_config.js` file:  
   ```js
   const USERNAME = "<USERNAME>";
   const PASSWORD = "<PASSWORD>";

Replace <USERNAME> and <PASSWORD> with the credentials of your MongoDB Atlas user.
Milestone 2: Basic Pipeline
## settin up jenkins
Set up Jenkins Pipeline

        Create a JenkinsFile with the necessary instructions.

        The pipeline should trigger automatically whenever you push a change to your repository.

        Ensure all required software is available (npm install is useful here).

        Deploy the application to Render using node server.

    Landing Page Update

        Add a big MILESTONE 2 on the landing page.

        Push your changes and confirm that the website on Render displays MILESTONE 2.


Milestone 3: Tests

    Run Existing Tests

        Switch to the test branch to access existing tests.

        Run the tests locally:

        npm test

        Test results should resemble darkroom_test.png.

    Merge Tests

        Merge the test branch into main.

        Update your JenkinsFile to execute tests as part of the pipeline.

        Configure email notifications if tests fail.

    Landing Page Update

        Add a big MILESTONE 3 on the landing page.

        Push your changes and confirm that the website on Render displays MILESTONE 2 and MILESTONE 3.

Milestone 4: Slack Integration

    Slack Setup

        Create a Slack channel named YourFirstName_IP1.

        Invite your team members.

    Integrate Slack with Jenkins

        Update your Jenkins pipeline to send a Slack message on successful deploy.

        The message should include:

            Build ID

            Link to the Render deployment

        Use environment variables to manage sensitive information.

    Landing Page Update

        Add a big MILESTONE 4 on the landing page.

        Push your changes and confirm that the website on Render displays MILESTONE 2, MILESTONE 3, and MILESTONE 4.
